the following code is for the UI to run according to user input,
(withthe exlusion of safe)
with safe being an expiriment to protect from user error.
(safe was not succesfull idea)
|#
(define dumb (lambda (n)
               (add1 (* 2 n))
               ))

(define fibo-acc (lambda (acc1 acc2 n)
                   (if
                    (equal? n 0)
                    (+ acc1 acc2)
                    (fibo-acc acc2 (+ acc1 acc2) (sub1 n))
                    )
                   ))

(define fibo (lambda (n)
                (fibo-acc 0 1 n)
                ))

(define series-acc (lambda(proc acc n)
                 (cond
                 [(equal? acc n) (writeln (number->string (proc acc)))]
                 [else
                 (begin
                 (writeln (number->string (proc acc)))(series-acc proc (add1 acc) n))
                 ]
                 )))
(define series (lambda (proc n)
                  (series-acc proc 1 n)
                  ))
(define series+ (lambda (proc n)
                (if
                (number? n)
                (series proc n)
                (writeln "not a number[NaN]")
                )
                  ))

I'm going to update the UI to allow same line inputs,
in the forms "fibo/x" "odds/x" & "luca/x"
|#
(define exec-form (lambda (command proc)
                    (series proc (string->number (substring (symbol->string command) 5)))
                  ))
(define test-form (lambda (command expect)
                    (equal? (substring (symbol->string command) 0 4) expect)
                  ))
#|
the mode variable is how the UI translates
the input into the code required to be run
and the help varible is text for the user to view,
with the "quit" and "xyzzy"
commands ideally cicrumenting the mode variable
|#
(define mode "none")
(define last "none")
(define help"
This program be can set to different calculation modes using simple commands,                                    
the commands Fibo/Fibonacci/F set the mode to calculate fibonacci numbers,                                       
the commands Odds/Odd numbers/O set the mode to calculate Odd numbers.                                           
once in these modes select a number for the program to use."

;;this is the old version of the UI, archived for comparision to the current code

                    (writeln ">:")
                    (let ((input (read)))

I'm planning to modify the UI so it uses aux functions,
so I can debug it more easily, and add a debug menu,
and thus gatekeep and troll any one who uses it.
the UI funtion uses iterative recursion to loop it's code
